We'll use [[!-VirtualBox-!][https://www.virtualbox.org]] to create a Linux virtual machine for development purposes. 

!1 Step 1: Download and install !-VirtualBox-!.  

[[Download][https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]] !-VirtualBox-!. Execute the exe file and follow the on-screen instructions.

!1 Step 2: Download [[Oracle Linux][https://edelivery.oracle.com/linux]] 

Create an oracle account if you don't already have it and download the main ISO file (name looks like this Oracle Linux 7 Update 1 for x86_64 (64 bit)). The download size is around 4 GB and it may take some time. 

!1 Step 3: Create Virtual Machine

!1 Step 4: Give a name to the virtual machine 

Depending on the name you provide it should automatically sort what kind of operating system is used but if you choose a custom name, you have to indicate what is the guest operating system.

!1 Step 5: Memory adjustment

Select the amount of RAM you want to allocate to this virtual machine. I suggest you to go with the recommended settings.

!1 Step 6: Virtual Hard Drive

If you have never created virtual machines before you will want to create a new Hard disk. It essentially creates a new virtual folder and calls it a virtual hard drive. All the virtual machines data is stored in that folder.
You can reuse a previously created hard disk as well, but stick to the recommended settings.

I chose to create a VMDK type hard disk because it can be ported to VMWare Workstation/Fusion as well. VMware is another popular virtual machine software(hypervisor).

Choose dynamic allocation, its flexible for our project. However, you can explore other options as well.

Give a name to the virtual hard drive and select how much space you want to allocate. 

NOTE: Virtual Machine name and Virtual Hard drive name aren't the same. You give a name to the hard disk so that you can reuse the hard disk in the future if need be.

!1 Step 7: Installing the OS on Virtual Machine

Power on the virtual machine by clicking on the "Start" button above.

Choose the iso of the OS or if you have inserted a DVD give the location of the dvd drive.

Virtual Machine Starts and the first page is displayed and from now on you have to follow the on screen instructions to install the guest OS.

!1 Step 8: Guest/Host Mouse integration - 

Since guest OS and Host OS are different environments when you click on the virtual box window, the control will goto the guest OS and you need to press "Right Ctrl" to 
give the control to the host OS again. By default the host key is "Right Ctrl" you can goto settings and change it to your convenience.
